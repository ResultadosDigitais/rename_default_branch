# GitHub

To rename the default branch:

1. Go to the "Settings" page of your repository.

2. Open "Branches" settings on the sidebar.

3. On "Default branch" section click on the pencil to edit.

4. Write the new default branch name and confirm.

That should rename the default branch and update all pull requests targeting this branch.

Your repository will be changed only on the server, so after that continue with the guide to rename all local copies.
